            (1) todo we don't need to write back everything every group commit.  we MUST write back
            that which is going to be a remapped on its private view - but that might not be all 
            views.

            (2) todo should we do this using N threads?  would be quite easy
                see Hackenberg paper table 5 and 6.  2 threads might be a good balance.

            (3) with enough work, we could do this outside the read lock.  it's a bit tricky though. 
                - we couldn't do it from the private views then as they may be changing.  would have to then 
                  be from the journal alignedbuffer.
                - we need to be careful the file isn't unmapped on us -- perhaps a mutex or something 
                  with MongoMMF on closes or something to coordinate that.

            locking: in read lock when called
