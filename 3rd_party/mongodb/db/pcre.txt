You need to install pcre.

This could be scripted:

cd /tmp
curl -O ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/pcre-7.4.tar.gz
tar -xzf pcre-7.4.tar.gz 
./configure --enable-utf8 --with-match-limit=200000 --with-match-limit-recursion=4000
make
make install


At that point is will be installed in /usr/*.  the version in p/pcre-7.4 is for VC++.
